**Saha, S., Neupane, S., Bellard, B., & Tripathi, H. (2025, October). Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Chronic Disease Self-Care Management: A Demonstration Workshop. In ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB 2025), Philadelphia, PA, USA.**  


## üìñ Overview  
Chronic diseases account for nearly **74% of global deaths**, highlighting the urgent need for scalable, effective self-care support. While day-to-day management‚Äîtaking medications, adjusting lifestyle, and monitoring symptoms‚Äîis essential, many patients struggle with adherence, especially those with limited health literacy or social support.  

AI-powered conversational agents have shown promise in bridging this gap, but existing systems often lack **personalization, contextual awareness, and adaptive reasoning**.  

This workshop introduces an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed for chronic disease management. Participants will explore how intelligent agents equipped with **multi-step reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and tool usage** can empower patients to take charge of their own care.  

A live demonstration will showcase these capabilities in a **heart failure case study**, while participants gain hands-on exposure to the architecture and workflow needed to build similar systems for broader health applications.

## üéØ Learning Objectives  
By the conclusion of this workshop, participants will be able to:  
- Recognize challenges in chronic disease self-care and how AI-driven assistants can help.  
- Understand the fundamentals of **RAG** and how **Agentic RAG** enhances it through multi-step retrieval and orchestration.  
- Learn about architecture components (LLMs, retrieval pipelines, agent frameworks, medical knowledge bases).  
- Observe a **live demo** of an Agentic RAG assistant applied to chronic disease management.  
- Gain familiarity with practical tools and best practices for development, including safety, privacy, and limitations.  
- Identify opportunities and future research directions for deploying agentic AI in personalized medicine.
