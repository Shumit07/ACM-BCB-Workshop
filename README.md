# HeartWise Agentic Patient Support System

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project showcases an advanced, agentic chatbot system named **HeartWise**. It is designed to assist patients by not only providing information but also by autonomously taking action in high-risk scenarios. When a high-risk patient expresses a need for help (e.g., "take action," "help me"), the system initiates a multi-step protocol to ensure the patient receives the appropriate level of care.

The core of this system lies in its ability to **perceive**, **reason**, and **act**. It perceives the user's intent, reasons about the best course of action based on the patient's specific context (like whether they have a primary care physician), and then acts by executing a series of tool callsâ€”summarizing clinical data, locating emergency rooms, and dispatching notifications.

## ðŸ¤– The Agentic Workflow

The agentic capability is triggered when a user with a 'high-risk' status uses an action-oriented prompt. The system then follows a dynamic, conditional workflow to achieve its goal of ensuring patient safety.
