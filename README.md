# Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Chronic Disease Self-Care Management  
*A Demonstration Workshop*  

## 📖 Overview  
Chronic diseases account for nearly **74% of global deaths**, highlighting the urgent need for scalable, effective self-care support. While day-to-day management—taking medications, adjusting lifestyle, and monitoring symptoms—is essential, many patients struggle with adherence, especially those with limited health literacy or social support.  

AI-powered conversational agents have shown promise in bridging this gap, but existing systems often lack **personalization, contextual awareness, and adaptive reasoning**.  

This workshop introduces an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed for chronic disease management. Participants will explore how intelligent agents equipped with **multi-step reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and tool usage** can empower patients to take charge of their own care.  

A live demonstration will showcase these capabilities in a **diabetes case study**, while participants gain hands-on exposure to the architecture and workflow needed to build similar systems for broader health applications.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:  
1. **Recognize** the self-care challenges faced by patients with chronic diseases.  
2. **Understand** the foundations of RAG and its agentic enhancements.  
3. **Learn** about architecture components such as LLMs, retrieval pipelines, and orchestration frameworks.  
4. **Observe** live demos of both RAG and Agentic RAG in action, including data retrieval and validated response generation.
