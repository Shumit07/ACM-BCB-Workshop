**Saha, S., Neupane, S., Bellard, B., & Tripathi, H. (2025, September). Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Chronic Disease Self-Care Management: A Demonstration Workshop. In ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB 2025), Philadelphia, PA, USA.**  


## üìñ Overview  
Chronic diseases account for nearly **74% of global deaths**, highlighting the urgent need for scalable, effective self-care support. While day-to-day management‚Äîtaking medications, adjusting lifestyle, and monitoring symptoms‚Äîis essential, many patients struggle with adherence, especially those with limited health literacy or social support.  

AI-powered conversational agents have shown promise in bridging this gap, but existing systems often lack **personalization, contextual awareness, and adaptive reasoning**.  

This workshop introduces an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed for chronic disease management. Participants will explore how intelligent agents equipped with **multi-step reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and tool usage** can empower patients to take charge of their own care.  

A live demonstration will showcase these capabilities in a **heart failure case study**, while participants gain hands-on exposure to the architecture and workflow needed to build similar systems for broader health applications.

## üíª Instructions for Participants  

### Minimum Requirements  
- Laptop with a modern browser  
- High-speed internet  
- (Optional) Google account for **Colab**, or Hugging Face / OpenAI accounts if using APIs  
- Basic Python familiarity (recommended for notebook demos)  

### Setup & Resources  
Prior to the workshop, participants will receive:  
- A **GitHub repository** with example code, notebooks, and sample data  
- A **Google Colab notebook** for interactive demos  

Steps:  
1. **Access notebooks**: open in Google Colab (preferred) or download locally  
2. **Download data**: sample datasets included in repo (synthetic patient records, knowledge bases)  
3. **Install dependencies**: via `requirements.txt` or provided Colab setup cells  
4. **API keys (if needed)**: instructions will be provided for any external APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT)  
5. **Test environment**: run a provided snippet to confirm everything works before the session
