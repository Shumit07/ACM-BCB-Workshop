# HeartWise Agentic Patient Support System

## 🚀 Agentic Capabilities Overview

This project is an **agentic AI system** designed to function as an autonomous support agent for high-risk cardiac patients. Unlike a standard chatbot that only answers questions, HeartWise perceives a user's need for direct intervention, reasons about the best course of action, and uses a suite of software tools to execute a multi-step plan to ensure patient safety.

The agent's core purpose is to bridge the gap between conversation and real-world action. When a high-risk patient signals distress, the agent autonomously performs the following functions:

* **Intent Recognition**: It actively listens for trigger phrases (e.g., "take action," "help me") to understand when a situation requires intervention beyond providing information.
* **Clinical Data Summarization**: It uses an external Large Language Model (LLM) to process complex patient data, including chat logs and existing notes, and synthesizes it into a concise clinical summary suitable for a medical professional.
* **Conditional Reasoning**: The agent's primary reasoning task is to analyze the summarized patient data to determine if a Primary Care Physician (PCP) is on file. This single decision point dictates its entire subsequent action plan.
* **Geospatial Tool Use**: If a PCP is not available, the agent autonomously uses a location intelligence toolset. It can convert a patient's address into geographic coordinates and then query an external mapping service (Overpass API) to find and rank nearby emergency rooms by distance.
* **Action Execution & Communication**: Based on its reasoning, the agent executes a final action by calling a communication tool. It either sends the clinical summary to the PCP on file or sends the summary and a list of nearby ERs directly to the patient.
* **Task Confirmation**: After completing its task, the agent reports its actions back to the user, providing a clear confirmation of the steps it has taken on their behalf.

## 🤖 The Agentic Workflow

The agentic capability is triggered when a user with a 'high-risk' status uses an action-oriented prompt. The system then follows a dynamic, conditional workflow to achieve its goal of ensuring patient safety.
