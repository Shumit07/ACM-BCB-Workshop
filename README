HeartWise — Simple RAD (Workshop Edition)
📌 Overview

This repository provides a workshop scaffold for learning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), evaluation, and the foundations of agentic healthcare AI.

The focus is on building simple RAG pipelines:

OpenAI API-based RAG (cloud, easy to start).

Local Hugging Face RAG (runs on CPU, no external API required).

The app also includes a minimal scraping example and evaluation logging to illustrate where retrieved content comes from and how to assess responses.

⚠️ Note: The AnythingLLM demo tab is included only to show what an integrated production system might look like. It is not part of the teaching workflow.

🗂️ App Structure

The Streamlit app is organized into six tabs:

💬 HeartWise (Demo)
Example of a production-style chatbot (via AnythingLLM). Not covered in workshop.

🕸️ Web Scrape (Example)
Single-page fetch and text extraction with BeautifulSoup.
Saves raw content as Markdown and generates a simple CSV report.

🧩 Simple RAG (OpenAI)
A hands-on pipeline:

Semantic retrieval (MiniLM).

Context grounding.

Answer generation via OpenAI Chat Completions.

Judge-lite scoring for clarity, empathy, safety.

🧩 Simple RAG (Local / Hugging Face)
Offline pipeline (no API keys required):

MiniLM retrieval.

Answer generation with FLAN-T5 (CPU-friendly).

Judge-lite scoring and reproducibility logs.

🔬 Explore (Lab)
Interactive playground for parameters (temperature, top-k), persona style, and system prompts.

🗂️ Ops & Logs
CSV logs for answers and judge runs, with quick download options for reproducibility.
